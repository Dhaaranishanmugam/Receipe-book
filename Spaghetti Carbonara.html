    <dd><p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish known for its creamy sauce made from eggs, cheese, and cured pork (typically pancetta or guanciale).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <p><li>350g spaghetti</li></p> 
        <p><li>150g pancetta or guanciale, diced (you can also use bacon as a substitute)</li></p>
        <p><li>3 large eggs</li></p>
        <p><li>50g grated Pecorino Romano cheese (or Parmesan cheese), plus extra for serving</li></p>
        <p><li>Freshly ground black pepper</li></p>
        <p><li>Salt (if needed, as the pancetta or guanciale and cheese are already salty)</li></p>
        <p><li>Chopped fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)</li></p>
    </ul>


    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <p><li>Cook the spaghetti: In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining. </li></p>
        <p><li>Prepare the sauce: While the spaghetti is cooking, whisk together the eggs, grated cheese, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper in a bowl. Set aside.</li></p>
        <p><li>Cook the pancetta/guanciale: In a large skillet or frying pan, cook the diced pancetta or guanciale over medium heat until crispy and browned. Remove from heat and set aside.</li></p>
        <p><li>Combine pasta and sauce: Immediately after draining the spaghetti, return it to the pot or a large bowl. Add the cooked pancetta/guanciale and toss to combine. Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta, tossing continuously until the eggs coat the spaghetti and create a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add some reserved pasta cooking water gradually until it reaches a creamy consistency.</li></p>
        <p><li>Serve: Divide the spaghetti carbonara among serving plates. Garnish with additional grated cheese, freshly ground black pepper, and chopped parsley (if using).</li></p>
       <!--<li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.</li>-->

    <dt><h2>Storage</h2></dt>
       <dd><p>Spaghetti Carbonara is best enjoyed immediately after cooking while the sauce is creamy and silky.</p>
        <p>Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat gently in a skillet over low heat, adding a splash of cream or pasta cooking water to revive the creamy texture.</p>
        <p>It's not recommended to freeze Spaghetti Carbonara as the texture of the eggs may change upon thawing.</p></dd>
